Program Description:
This program will interact with the user to sell them tickets in fun manor. The theater has a total of 20 tickets and it sells all 20 to a plethora of groups.
It's purpose is to do what I just said without have to factor for human error in selling the 20 tickets. This allows for the ticket booth selling to be automated
and the rest of the employees can work in other stations. Taking some of the stress off the general cast of workers throughout the shift.

Logical Steps:
1.) Set up a Function: The "sell_tickets" function abbreviates the logic for selling tickets.
2.) Input: The program uses 'input()' to get the number of tickets a user wants to buy.
3.) Output: The program uses "print()' to inform the buyer about the overall status of the purchase. Meaning if they can even buy for that amount of people and remaing tickets.
4.) Accumulator: 'tickets_sold' and 'total_buyers' are accumulators used to keep track of the number of tickets sold and the toal number of buyers. Each broken up into their 
	own accumulator.
5.) if Statement: 'if' statements were used to validate the number of requested tickets and ensure there was enough for the homies buying it.
6.) Loop: Finally, I used a 'while' loop as it continues running until all tickets are sold.

*if I am being completely honest I think I combined the Logical Steps and Functions parts. Which is incredibly unfortunate. These are also the steps you told us to use
	so this could be completely wrong and for that im sorry."
