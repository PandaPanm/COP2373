1. Overview
This program creates a database named `population_YI.db` to simulate and visualize population growth for 10 cities in Florida.

2. Database Design
- Database: `population_YI.db`
- Table: `population`
  - Fields: `city` (TEXT), `year` (INTEGER), `population` (INTEGER)

3. Program Functions
  A. `setup_database()`: 
   - Creates the database and initializes the `population` table.
   - Inserts population data for 2023 for 10 cities in Florida: Pensacola, Deltona, Naples, Cape Coral, Palm Bay, Hollywood, Kissimmee, Clearwater, Port St. Lucie, West Palm Beach.

  B. `simulate_population_growth(db_name)`:
   - Simulates a 2% yearly population growth for 20 years (2024â€“2043) for each city.
   - Inserts this data into the database.

  C. `plot_population_growth(db_name, city)`:
   - Fetches population data for the selected city.
   - Visualizes growth using Matplotlib.

  D. `main()`:
   - Initializes the database and growth simulation.
   - Allows the user to select a city and view its growth until exiting.

4. Tools Used
- Python
- SQLite3 for database management.
- Matplotlib for data visualization.

5. Testing
- Verified database creation and data insertion.
- Tested growth simulation for accuracy.
- Confirmed accurate and clear visualization for each city.
