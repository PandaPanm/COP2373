The goal of this program is to create a magic 8-ball that will respond to a user's questions. Honestly, I think it went well. If this was not a project
and I knew I wouldn't be judged there would be more inappropriate responses because that would be incredibly funny.

*I will also say I don't know if the responses are how you want them and I could see points being taken off for that. I also do not know if you care for my 
	self critiques.*

How it works!

1.) So, to start I created a response list for my beautiful magic 8-ball that will be used to answer a user's questions.

2.) Then, the program opens the file using 'load_responses' and reads all lines. 

3.) I ran the list of responses before making the main program to actually create a txt. file

4.) Finally, when the user is done then can type 'quit' and the program kills itself. rip program.

1.5) we import random so the 8ball randomly takes an answer from the txt. file created.
